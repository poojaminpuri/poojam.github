        <p>Analyzing sales data from a coffee shop provides invaluable insights into consumer preferences, peak sales periods, and product performance.
            By examining this data, we can identify trends such as the most popular beverages, seasonal variations in sales, and the impact of promotions and marketing campaigns.
